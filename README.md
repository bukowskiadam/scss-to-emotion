# Emotion problems example

In this project I wanted to show what problems you might experience when porting styles
from SCSS modules to emotion.

Some may say that this is not the "proper way" to use emotion
but we have a pretty large codebase of styles in the project, which is embedded in other
projects. Our goal was to get rid of the SCSS to generate a bundle with JS code only.
